## An automatic acronym suggestion system is a computer program that can provide a list of acronyms automatically based on the user's input. 

The definition of the acronym in this project is an English abbreviation formed from any letters of a sentence from start to end and pronounced as another word. There are a lot of acronym finders on the internet, but most of them have a problem, they only form acronyms by taking the first letter from a word or the suggested acronyms are hard to memorize and meaningless. This project aims to implement an acronym suggestion system according to the project definition and provide meaningful and easy-to-memorize acronyms. To achieve this, I compared multiple algorithmsâ€™ advantages and implemented my own algorithm which can automatically suggest a list of acronyms from a list of dictionary words. The result shows that the program can accurately scan all acronyms without any miss. It provides acronyms in a short time and can automatically sort the list of acronyms so that short and meaningful acronyms are shown first. However, more work could be done to examine the efficiency of the program.
